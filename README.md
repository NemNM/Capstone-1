# Capstone-1

The Capstone project I selected is the Food Deamnd Forecasting Challenge from Analytics Vidhya.  Link:https://datahack.analyticsvidhya.com/contest/genpact-machine-learning-hackathon-1/#LeaderBoard
The scope of this problem is to accurately forecast food demand of a food delivery company with multiple food centers in multiple cities.
As the initial part of the project I cleaned the data and conducted a EDA to determine any initial findings from the dataset. 

The model was trained and tested for initial data and model behaved totally different for linear regression vs decision tree method.  The train and test data was very much similar for linear regression model while a very high discrepancy in train and test data was observed for decision tree model.
